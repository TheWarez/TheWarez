### Hi there 👏
## I'm Warez/Gabriel
- My name is Gabriel, I'm 17 years old and I'm a junior developer. 🌛
- I am currently studying: PHP, JS, NodeJS.
- I started studying programming 10 months ago and I'm evolving little by little.
- The reason why I started studying programming was because from an early age I was interested in technology and learning new things, so programming was what caught my attention.
